					Coding in Germany				
				
					
				
		
					
				
				
					Germany is in need of highly skilled and practically trained AI and software engineering talents to stay internationally relevant for its innovative and digital capability. Approximately 700K additional tech specialists are needed in Germany by 2023. Traditional tech education in Germany is often unable to use the most up to date tech knowledge, and does not always train the skills that are most in demand: practical coding skills, autonomous problem solving skills and social skills.
Thanks to the support of the visionary Dieter Schwarz Foundation, 42 will be opening a location in Heilbronn, Baden-Wuerttemberg. We believe that 42 is the answer to the changing educational needs: a revolution of education – based in the south of Germany. The Dieter Schwarz Foundation, of the founder of the Schwarz group with the supermarket chains Lidl and Kaufland, supports 42Heilbronn next to several other institutions from dual studies to university studies up to various research and start-up initiatives. 42 Heilbronn will welcome over 600 students in a refurbished historical machine factory, and will open doors in Q1 2021. The building is located very close to the Bildungscampus where the 42-Heilbronn students can use the same facilities as all other students in Heilbronn.
Heilbronn is a town near Stuttgart, in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, the state with highest investment in (digital) research, and dense economic activity. It is named Germany’s nr. 5 most dynamic city, with steep economical growth over the past years. The region is in need of over 1,500 additional tech specialists per year

					THERE WAS A BUG IN THE SYSTEMAND WE FIXED IT				
				
					
				
		
					
		
				
				
					PROJECT-BASED LEARNINGStudents take ownership of their learning. Most importantly, surpassing oneself is the only way to move forward, yet you can always count on the strength of the group.				
				
				
				
					PEER-TO-PEER PEDAGOGYEach student must problem solve, work with others and fail a few times to find the answer. We provide you with the environment, tools, support, and community to find the answers.				
				
				
				
					GAMIFIED CURRICULUMOur learning program is structured like a tree. As you near the end of a branch, the branch splits and more projects are unlocked. This way, each student’s learning is unique.				
				
				
				
					CAMPUS OPEN 24/7Everyone learns at their own pace. That's why the campus is open 24/7. It is also baby-friendly and dog-friendly. There are nap and yoga rooms, showers, and more.				
				
				
				
					WE CELEBRATE FAILUREYou will not be penalised if you fail a project. Instead, we see this as a necessary step to levelling up. Failing is a part of the learning journey, since this is how we truly improve.				
				
				
				
					NO TUITION FEESEducation at 42 Berlin is 100% free.Thanks to donations from our partner companies, we provide tech education, without any red tape.

									Before you start studying with us, you need to complete the Piscine, a 26-day coding challenge. Once you pass it your coding journey begins.The 42 Berlin curriculum, inspired by École 42 in Paris, focuses on hands-on learning and peer collaboration. With 12,000+ global students, it teaches coding from scratch, supporting beginners and advancing those with prior knowledge.You advance your knowledge by completing practical projects. These will be evaluated both by our evaluation software and your peers. This learning process makes our graduates extremely adept at communication, as well as preparing them for an independent work environment.								
				
				
		
				
				
							
							
					
													
															
								
														
												1. The Piscine (26 days)
					
					The 26-day long intensive programming bootcamp is part of the application process at 42. Designed as a 7 days/week experience, it allows applicants to learn the basics of Shell and C programming language from scratch. Those who successfully complete the Piscine become 42 students.
				
							
					
													
															
								
														
												2. Core Curriculum (12-18 months)
					
					Starting PointYour official studies at 42 Berlin begin with the Core Curriculum after passing the Piscine. Initially, all students start from the same point, learning essential soft and hard skills. Completion time varies based on your study dedication.Core SubjectsThe initial program covers a broad range of basics valuable for any career path, including Unix C, algorithms, networks, system administration, graphics programming, object-oriented coding, and more.Gamified LearningOur gamified model lets you unlock progressively harder projects as you earn experience points. Moreover, without penalties for failure, projects are structured like a tree, branching into different paths, allowing you to explore various aspects of coding and IT.This unique approach means each student’s journey is personalized, experimenting with different projects and specializations.Time CommitmentThe Core Curriculum typically takes 18 months of full-time study. While 42 offers flexibility, the maximum completion time is two years. However, although some students may take side jobs, we recommend focusing full-time on 42 studies due to the program’s challenging nature and the need for steady progress.
				
							
					
													
															
								
														
												3. First Internship (4-6 months)
					
					After completing the core curriculum, you’ll have the opportunity to apply your new skills in a professional setting.Students gain direct access to opportunities with renowned partner companies such as Microsoft, VW, CARIAD, Capgemini, T-Systems, SAP, and Bayer.Nonetheless, you’re not obligated to work with these partners if you prefer alternative options.
				
							
					
													
															
								
														
												4. Specialisation (up to 5 years)
					
					The main part of the 42 curriculum allows you to specialize in various fields at any 42 campus globally.Specializations include advanced algorithms and AI, game development, mobile and web development, cybersecurity, advanced Unix and networking, and SEA:ME.In addition, our team regularly regularly introduces new options. Upon completing your specialization, you’ll possess senior software engineer skills, ready to decide when to become a 42 Alumni.

												What do I need to do to get in?
					
					After registration, you will need to pass a two-hour long online test, composed of cognitive games.If you succeed, you will need to clear the last hurdle, the ‘Piscine’; our one-month-long selection process. During this intensive month, you will be immersed in our method to evaluate your potential. Successful completion of the Piscine ensures eligibility for our full curriculum.
				
							
					
													
															
								
														
												Do I need to know how to code to join?
					
					Nope! We welcome in beginners and advanced coders alike. Of course, the programme might be initially more challenging if you’re never coded before, however it is designed to be completed by any level of experience.
				
							
					
													
															
								
														
												Can I study remotely?
					
					No, we do not provide any online or remote study options. As a result, all students are required to complete the program with access to the campus. Most importantly, we’ve found that our peer-learning method is much more effective when done in person.
				
							
					
													
															
								
														
												Does 42 Berlin provide accommodation? 
					
					Even though we don’t provide our pisciners or students with accommodation or accommodation support, we can connect you with other pisciners before you begin and send you some useful hints about finding a flat in Berlin!
